RFM is a classic Lifetime and Responsiveness segmentation model. It has been trialed and tested over the years and is a great starting point for any retailer including eCommerce companies looking to manage their customer base more proactively. 

```
Recency (R) - Time since last purchase in days
Frequency (F) - Total number of purchases
Monetary value (M) - Total monetary value
```
